20074625	This study explored the effects of exogenous administration of 0.1 M riluzole on the neurite growth of specific subpopulations of adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in vitro. Neuronal branching and neurite length were measured in calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), Griffonia simplicifolia Isolectin B4 (IB4), N52 and parvalbumin positive neuronal subpopulations. Riluzole was found to enhance neurite branching in both CGRP and IB4 positive neurons compared to vehicle treated cultures. However, neurite length was only significantly increased in CGRP positive neurons in riluzole treated cultures.|CGRP positive neurons treated with riluzole showed a significant increase in neurons with complex branching (42.3.01.2%, Fig. 1C-E) compared with those with no outgrowths (23.41.3%) and to complex outgrowths in vehicle treated cultures (25.72.0%, Fig. 1A, B). Quantitative analysis of the longest neurite per cell (Fig. 5) showed that riluzole significantly increased neurite length in CGRP positive neurons (310.622.3 m) compared to vehicle treated cultures (192.536.5 m).|Examples of CGRP positive neurons in vehicle treated (A, B) and riluzole treated (C, D) cultures.
