Data are presented as two files. First, we present the document-level judgements, where documents are denoted by their PubMed ID, an INCLUDE judgement indicates it was determined to contain relevant information for the Neuron Registry, and an EXCLUDE judgement indicates that it did not. Second, we present the sentence-level annotations for the positive class documents. Documents are again designated according to their PubMed ID, and the respective SUPPORT column entries indicate the sentence span containing information leading to an INCLUDE judgement. Importantly, because some documents had more than one sentence leading to an INCLUDE judgement, some documents have multiple rows.
